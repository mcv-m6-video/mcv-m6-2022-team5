# Week 4

## Datasets

* AICityChallenge

* KITTI: flow 2012

## Tasks

* T1 Optical Flow
    * T1.1 Optical Flow with Block Matching
    * T1.2 Off-the-shelf Optical Flow
    * T1.3 Object Tracking with Optical Flow
* T2 Multi-target single-camera (MTSC) tracking
    * T2.1 Evaluate MTSC on SEQ 3
    * T2.2 Evaluate MTSC on SEQ 1 & SEQ 4


## Deliverables

- Task 1.1 Block Matching code is in `blockMatching.ipynb`

- Task 1.2 visualisation done in `task_1-2.ipynb`, with `.png` results stored in the `task_1-2_results/` folder. Perceiver-IO is ran using `Perceiver - optical_flow.ipynb` on google colab.

- Task 1.3 is in `task1_3.ipynb`

- The main class used along the week project is VehicleDetection, stored in `VehicleDetection.py`. Stores information per detection, the main attributes are the frame number, the confidence value and the 4 corners of the bounding box. It also implements functions like IoU.

- Functions to evaluate (adapted AP from detectron and multiple AP with random shuffling of detections without confidence) detections bounding boxes are located in `eval_utils.py`

- Functions to generate animated GIFs with the bounding boxes are located in `video_utils.py`






### Extra results for Task 1.1
More result examples of the grid search performed can be generated using `plot_3d.py`. The possible arguments are:
  - -d DATA, --data DATA  Relative path to json with grid search data
  - -c COMPENSATION, --compensation COMPENSATION
                        Compensation type: backward - forward
  - -f FUNCTION, --function FUNCTION
                        Distance function: ncc - ssd - sad
  - -s STRIDE, --stride STRIDE
                        Stride value used in grid seatch (data.json contains 1 and 2)


### Extra results for Task 2
More predictions for different videos can be made with the `tas2_predict.py` script. The possible arguments are:
  usage: tas2_predict.py [-h] [-v VIDEO] [-o OUT_PATH] [-m MODEL] [-d DETECTIONS] [-l LOAD_W] [-c PRED_CLASS]

Arguments to run the inference script

  - -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  - -v VIDEO, --video VIDEO
                        Absolute path to video to extract images
  - -o OUT_PATH, --out_path OUT_PATH
                        Relative path to output folder
  - -m MODEL, --model MODEL
                        Detectron2 Model
  - -d DETECTIONS, --detections DETECTIONS
                        Name of the file to save the detections
  - -l LOAD_W, --load_w LOAD_W
                        Path to trained weights
  - -c PRED_CLASS, --pred_class PRED_CLASS
                        Class to prediect
